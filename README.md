# cnn-model--classififying-cat-and-dog
This repository contains a Python-based deep learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal of this project is to build a robust image classifier capable of distinguishing between these two common pet species.
# Cat and Dog Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Welcome to the Cat and Dog Classifier project! This repository contains a deep learning model that can classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Whether you're a pet lover, a machine learning enthusiast, or just curious, this project will show you how to build and train a CNN for image classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided notebooks)

You can install these packages using `pip`:


### Dataset

To train and test the model, you'll need a dataset of labeled cat and dog images. You can use the dataset we used or replace it with your own. Make sure to organize the data into appropriate train, validation, and test sets.

### Training

Use the provided scripts to train the model. You can customize the hyperparameters and architecture in the configuration files. To start training, run:


### Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test set using:


You'll get metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Inference

To make predictions on new images, use the inference script:


Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks for detailed insights into the project. These notebooks include visualizations, training logs, and explanations of the model's behavior.

- `visualize_training.ipynb`: Visualize the training process, including loss and accuracy curves.
- `model_explanation.ipynb`: Dive into the CNN architecture and see how it extracts features.
